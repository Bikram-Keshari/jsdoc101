# JSDoc 101

JSDoc is used to make your JavaScript API code comments much better.

Usually, it is known as documentation comments, as you can generate beautiful documents out of it.

> The awesome thing is most of the popular IDEs and Editors support it by default. Like in VS Code, after adding JSDoc tags you can hover upon the doclet to view its documentation.

> Supports TypeScript as well.

> Just have a look at the _index.js_ file before getting started.

## Quick Start

**Make sure Node.js and NPM are installed**

- Clone this repository and navigate to the root folder

- Execute command `npm install` to install the dependencies like [jsdoc](https://preview.npmjs.com/package/jsdoc) and a development server [live-server](https://preview.npmjs.com/package/live-server)

- The final step is to execute the command `npm start`

That's it. It will open the documentation server in your default browser.
